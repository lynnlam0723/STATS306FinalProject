The [Internet Movie Database (IMDb)]() contains information on millions of movies and television programs. They offer several [non-commercial use datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).

These data are quite numerous, included with the this project is a random sample of 100,000 titles (movies/TV programs), along with all all the ratings associated with those titles, all principals (actors) involved in the production, and some basic demographics about those actors. More details on the pre-processing can be found in the `/original` folder in this directory. Due to size constraints, the original data is not included in this repository, but you can down load the `.tsv.gz` files from the link above if you wish to recreate these files.

## Tables

The data will require additional arguments to the `read_csv` to properly handle how missing data is coded. These code chunk is provide as an example only.

```{r cache = TRUE}
title_basics <- read_csv('title_basics_sample.csv.gz', na = "\\N")
title_principals <- read_csv('title_principals_sample.csv.gz', na = "\\N")
title_ratings <- read_csv('title_ratings_sample.csv.gz', na = "\\N")
names_basics <- read_csv('name_basics_sample.csv.gz', na = "\\N")
```
